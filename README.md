week 6 Homework assignment with giphy
i had an one result showing but then i couldnt get the loop to work with each entry
the entries are appended to the array and then appended to the button loop.
when i comment out the 'for loop', one entry is displayed after clicking the button.
i have errors that i dont know how to diagnose to figure out what is wrong with the application.
i also cannot figure out how to display the results below the 'submit' button instead of between the two buttons.
i have not figured out how to empty the submit form once the submit button is pressed.
